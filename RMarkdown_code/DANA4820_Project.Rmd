###Social.Activity == never: 
Since chi.square p-value > 0.05, we fail to reject H0 ùúÉ=1, the odd of having a high level carbon emission for each diet category are NOT different for people who never going social , we conclude that there is no association between whether having a high level carbon emission and dietary choices.
From confidence interval results, since 1 is in the CI(0.975007 1.431037) we conclude there is not enough evidence to say there is association between Dietary choices and CarbonEmissionLevel.

###Social.Activity == often: 
Since chi.square p-value <0.05, we reject H0 ùúÉ=1, the odd of having a high level carbon emission for each diet category are different for people who often going social , we conclude that there is association between whether having a high level carbon emission and dietary choices.
From confidence interval results (1.086801 1.591709), we are 95% confident that the odd of XXX for XXX is between XXX XXX than the odd of XXX for XXX for people who often going social.

###Social.Activity == sometimes: 
Since chi.square p-value <0.05, we reject H0 ùúÉ=1, the odd of having a high level carbon emission for each diet category are different for people who sometimes going social , we conclude that there is association between whether having a high level carbon emission and dietary choices.

#? how to interpret CI(1.109186 1.644661), which group'odd is higher??

```{r}
library(tidyr)

# Step 1: Create a 3-way contingency table
contingency_table <- xtabs(~ CarbonEmission.Level + Diet + Social.Activity, data=train)

# Step 2: Convert the table to a long-format data frame
long_df <- as.data.frame.table(contingency_table)

# Step 3: Reshape the long-format data frame to a wide format
wide_df <- pivot_wider(long_df, names_from = CarbonEmission.Level, values_from = Freq,
                       id_cols = c(Social.Activity, Diet))
wide_df
# Now `wide_df` is a data frame with `Social.Activity` and `Diet` as hierarchical indices
# and different `CarbonEmission.Level` categories as columns.

## Q2 GLM  , 1000 dollor increases in bill has 5.5% increase in the number of cloth bought

log(pi) = b0 + b1*bill
bi = 5.467e-05
this means 1000 dollar increase in bill, the log(pi) increase bi = 5.467e-05 * 1000, then pi increase 

> exp(5.467e-05)
