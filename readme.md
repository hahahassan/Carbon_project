## Introduction

This project aims to explore the intricate relationship between lifestyle choices and carbon footprint levels among individuals. Utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle, our team intends to conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis to uncover patterns and associations that might contribute to higher carbon emission levels.

## Dataset Overview

Our analysis is based on a dataset that includes information about individuals' carbon footprints, with a focus on various lifestyle factors such as dietary choices, social activities, and consumption habits.

**Population**: Individuals with measured or estimated carbon footprints.

**Sample Size**: 10,000 individuals.

**Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dumanmesut/individual-carbon-footprint-calculation?resource=download&select=Carbon+Emission.csv)

## Objectives

The primary goal is to use statistical tools in R, such as chi-squared tests, odds ratios in three-way tables, and generalized linear models, to investigate the following questions:

1. Is there a significant association between dietary choices and carbon emission levels, and how does social activity influence this relationship?
2. How do the number of clothes purchased monthly and the monthly grocery bill relate, when analyzed through a generalized linear model?
3. Is there a linear relationship between levels of social activity and the propensity to choose energy-efficient options?

## Variables

- **Diet** (Categorical): The type of diet an individual follows.
- **Social Activity** (Categorical): The frequency of participating in social activities.
- **Energy Efficiency** (Categorical): Preference for purchasing energy-efficient devices.
- **Carbon Emission** (Numerical): The total carbon emissions of an individual.
- **How Many New Clothes Monthly** (Numerical): The number of new clothes purchased each month.
- **Monthly Grocery Bill** (Numerical): The amount spent on groceries each month, in dollars.

## Analysis Tools

- **R**: For all statistical analyses including chi-squared tests, calculation of odds ratios, and fitting generalized linear models.
